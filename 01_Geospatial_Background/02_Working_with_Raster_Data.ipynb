    "> In [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics) and [digital photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography), a raster graphic represents a two-dimensional picture as a rectangular matrix or grid of [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel), viewable via a [computer display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_display), [paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper), or other display medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term *\"raster data\"* or *\"raster\"* originated in computer graphics; in essence, a *raster* refers to a sequence of numerical values arranged into a rectangular table (similar to a [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)) from [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster datasets are useful to represent continuous quantities—pressure, elevation, temperature, land cover classification, etc.—sampled on a [tesselation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation), i.e, a discrete grid that partitions a two-dimensional region of finite extent. In the context of [*Geographic Information Systems (GIS)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system), the spatial region is planar projection of a portion of the Earth's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rasters approximate continuous numerical distributions by storing individual values within each *grid cell* or *pixel* (a term derived from *\"picture element\"* in computer graphics). Rasters can represent data gathered over various types of non-rectangular grid cells (e.g., hexagons); for our purposes, we'll restrict our attention to grids in which all the pixels are rectangles of the same height and width.\n",

    "An important subtle difference between a numerical matrix familiar from linear algebra and a raster in the context of GIS is that real datasets are often incomplete. That is, a raster may have entries missing or it may include pixel values that were corrupted during the measurement process. As such, most raster data includes a scheme to represent \"No Data\" values for any pixels where no meaningful observation is possible. The scheme may use ['NaN' (\"Not-a-Number\")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN) for floating-point data or a [*sentinel value*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value) for integer data (e.g., using `-1` to signal missing data where meaningful integer data is strictly positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important property of raster data is that pixel values are stored using an appropriate *data type* for the context. For instance, continuous features like elevation or temperature would often be stored as raster data using floating-point numbers; by contrast, categorical properties (like land cover types) may be stored using unsigned integers. Raster datasets are often large, so choosing the data type judiciously can reduce file size significantly without compromising the quality of information. We shall see this in examples later."

    "Each pixel of a raster data set is indexed by its *row* & *column* position relative to the top left corner — the *image* or *pixel coordinates*. These values represent the displacement from the top left corner of the matrix, conventionally expressed using [zero-based numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering). For instance, using zero-based indexing in the $10\\times10$ grid of pixels displayed below, the top left corner pixel has index (0,0); the top right corner pixel has index (0,9); the bottom left corner pixel has index (9,0); and the bottom right corner pixel has index (9,9).\n",

    "Another subtle distinction between matrices and rasters is that raster data is typically *georeferenced*; this means that each cell is associated with a specific geographic rectangle on the Earth's surface with some positive area. That in turn means that each pixel value is associated not only with its pixel/image coordinates but also with the *continuous coordinates* of every spatial point within that physical rectangle. That is, there is a *continuum* of spatial coordinates associated with every pixel as opposed to a single pair of pixel coordinates. For instance, in the $5\\times5$ grid of pixels shown below in the left plot, the red dot associated with the pixel coordinates $(0,1)$ is located at the center of that pixel. At the same time, the right plot shows a red dot with continuous coordinates $(-0.2,0.4)$.\n",

    "There are two important distinctions to observe:\n",

    "+ Image coordinates are typically expressed in the *opposite order* of continuous coordinates. That is, for image coordinates $(r,c)$, the vertical position—the row $r$—is the first ordinate and the horizontal position—the column $c$—is the second ordinate. By contrast, when expressing a location in continuous coordinates $(x,y)$, conventionally, the horizontal position $x$ is the first ordinate and the vertical position $y$ is the second ordinate.\n",
    "+ The orientation of the vertical axis is reversed between pixel and continuous coordinates (even though the orientation of the horizontal axis is the same). That is, the row index $r$ increases *downwards* from the top left corner in pixel coordinates while the vertical continuous coordinate $y$ increases *upwards* from the bottom left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflicting conventions with zero-based indexing and order of coordinates are a source of a lot of programming headaches. For instance, in practical terms, some GIS tools require coordinates to be provided as `(longitude, latitude)` and others require `(latitude,longitude)`. With luck, GIS users can rely on the software tools to handle these inconsistencies transparently (see, e.g., [this discussion in the Holoviz documentation](https://holoviews.org/user_guide/Continuous_Coordinates.html)). When computed results don't make sense, the important point is to always ask:\n",
